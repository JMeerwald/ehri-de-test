{{< intro >}}
The [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)](https://www.ehri-project.eu) is an international 
infrastructure securing Holocaust research, commemoration and education on a trans-national level. 
EHRI-UK is the national node representing the United Kingdom within this international research consortium.

### EHRI-DE will serve as the national node, representing Germany within the consortium of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI). In fulfilling its mission of enhancing and supporting Holocaust research in Germany, EHRI-DE will pursue a number of objectives. These include:

* Linking institutions involved in Holocaust Studies, Education and Commemoration and providing excellent networking opportunities on a national and transnational level
* Interconnecting Holocaust-related archival resources and institutions
* Offering fellowship and training opportunities for early career scholars, archivists, educators and those committed to Holocaust Commemoration
* Fostering a transnational historiography of the Holocaust
Developing and securing a digital infrastructure for Holocaust Studies

EHRI's impact is primarily scientific, however, the infrastructure also advances a wider
social and political agenda. The recent rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and aggressive
nationalisms in Europe and beyond demonstrate that Holocaust research is never a purely
academic concern, but a prerequisite for open and non-discriminatory societies across
Europe and beyond.
