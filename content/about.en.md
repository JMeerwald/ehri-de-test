infrastructure securing Holocaust research, commemoration and education on a trans-national level. 
{{< /intro >}}

### EHRI-DE is the National Node, representing Germany within the consortium of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure and continuing its services and activities on a national level. 

Given Germany's particular role as the main perpetrator state of the Holocaust and the responsibility this entails, EHRI-DE will pursue its mission to strengthen and support Holocaust research and education and to contribute to a solid basis for commemorating the victims of National Socialism in Germany and beyond. EHRI-DE pursues a number of key objectives: 

* Transfer of knowledge: Linking institutions involved in Holocaust Studies and providing a platform for professional exchange and development of research projects 
* Interconnecting Holocaust-related data 
* Offering access to resources and training opportunities  
* Fostering a transnational historiography of the Holocaust 
* Strengthen social resilience, diversity and inclusion as well as combatting antisemitism
