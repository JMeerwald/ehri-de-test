{{< /intro >}}

### EHRI-DE is the National Node, representing Germany within the consortium of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure and continuing its services and offerings on a national level. 

Given Germany's particular role as the main perpetrator of the Holocaust and the responsibility this entails, EHRI-DE will fulfil its mission to strengthen and support Holocaust research and education and to contribute to a solid basis for commemorating the victims of National Socialism in Germany and beyond. EHRI-DE pursues a number of key objectives: 

* Transfer of knowledge: Linking institutions involved in Holocaust Studies, and Interconnecting Holocaust-related archival resources
* Offering transnational access and training opportunities for early career scholars, archivists, educators and those committed to Holocaust Commemmoration 
* Fostering a transnational historiography of the Holocaust 
* Developing and securing a digital infrastructure for Holocaust Studies 
* Strengthen social resilience, diversity and inclusion as well as fighting anti-Semitism through Holocaust Education
