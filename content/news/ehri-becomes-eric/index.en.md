The European Commission has granted the legal status of European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) to the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI), making EHRI the 
30th ERIC established since 2011. This recognition highlights EHRI’s vital role in safeguarding the historical record of the Holocaust and its ongoing relevance to modern society.

This development marks a significant step forward in EHRI’s mission to bridge the gaps between dispersed archival materials across Europe and beyond. By doing so, it seeks to overcome 
the fragmentation of Holocaust historiography and foster a more comprehensive understanding of this pivotal event in European history. Since 2010, EHRI has been working to integrate 
Holocaust research and documentation through EU-funded initiatives. In 2018, it was included in the roadmap of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI).

**Ekaterina Zaharieva**, Commissioner for Startups, Research and Innovation said: "I warmly welcome the establishment of EHRI as an ERIC. As we continue to drive innovation and 
excellence in European research, EHRI’s cutting-edge infrastructure and services plays a vital role in promoting open access to historical data, fostering new centres of excellence, 
and safeguarding Europe’s shared heritage. I am confident that EHRI will continue to inspire new generations of researchers and scholars to explore the complexities of the Holocaust 
and its impact on European society."

EHRI will mark the recognition of its legal status on Sunday 26 January during an inauguration ceremony at the POLIN Museum in Warsaw, Poland.
